Write a C++ program to allow the user to create a test bank of questions. The program should first ask the user how many questions he or she wishes to create. This quantity will be the first line in the test bank. The user should now be prompted for all information for each question, and then that question is written out to the test bank in the exact format specified in the Phase 2 Individual Project.For each question, the following information should be gathered:Question type: Multiple choice (MC) or True/False (TF)
Question value
Actual question
If the question is TF, then get answer
If the question is MC, then get the number of options followed by each option and finally the answer
This program should be robust and allow users who make mistakes the ability to correct them (exception handling).
